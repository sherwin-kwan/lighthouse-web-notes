# Getting an interview

## Networking - the more efficient method

  * People you know on LinkedIn?
* Sharing projects
  * Can be combined with LinkedIn, you'll be able to share links to projects so connections AND connections of connections can see them
* Recruiters:
  * Someone who can vouch for you and knows employers
  * Not the best strategy for junior devs, recruiters are mostly used for intermediate/senior devs
* Alumni connections:
  * Employees at a company may be LHL alumni, so there's a point of connection to reach out

## Applying for Public Postings

* Even though it's less efficient, it's still needed since most people have a limited pool of connections
* Resume + cover letter

## Employer vs. Employee Perspective

* Employers generally see connections as the best way to find employees (there's a level of trust you don't get from random people hiring off an interview)

# Excelling at Interviews

## Deportment

* Watch your body language - eye contact with the camera
* Use voice inflections
* Have a plain, neutral background
* Plan B: Prepare to use a smartphone if internet connection is spotty
* Know the interview software

## Preparation

* Know why you want to work for them
* Know your skills - what you have to offer technically + transferrable skills
* Know your goals
* Good to know the company's vision and mission, potential coworkers, etc.
* Do informational interviews
* Know where the interview is (physically or online), arrive early but not THAT early (20 minutes early is too early)

* Mutual goals

## Ways to sell yourself

* Remember: Time constraints/quick learning of bootcamp is very helpful!

# The Aftermath

* Remember to send a thank-you letter!
  * Also gives you a chance at redemption if you performed poorly at the interview
* Set a reminder to follow up at the time the company says they will decide
* What to expect: in Vancouver, expect $40-60K for a junior developer position
* Salary negotiations usually take place at the offer stage. Have a salary range (around a 10K range)
