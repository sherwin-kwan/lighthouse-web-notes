# Day 49 - 19 Nov 2020

## Reflection

* We have now seen that it is possible to learn ... the ladder has no top, there is no end to learning
* Lighthouse is there to support, but KV's philosophy: "Labbers get 80% of the credit, because they put in 80% of the hard work"
* You will always have the opportunity to learn new things
* Get all the risks sorted out EARLY
* Communications breakdowns are the worst, sort that out ASAP
