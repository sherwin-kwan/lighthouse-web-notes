## Day 2 - 15 Sep 2020

## Sherwin's Notes from Morning Announcements

### Technical interviews:

* Technical interviews will take place on a regular basis throughout the bootcamp. 
* They usually take around 1 hour (if you're fast you might get it done in 30 minutes). 
* You will be given an appointment in advance, between noon and 8 pm PT.
* Mentors will message you in Slack when they're ready, but please BE EARLY. 
* These resemble whiteboarding interviews, the goal is to figure out how you think
* Jamboard and Google Hangouts are used for technical interviews

### Extracurriculars

* Students are encouraged to do extracurricular activities together
* Don't be a loner
* Jackbox games, Zoom timeslots, etc. may be requested from Lighthouse Labs

### Tests

* Tests take place every Friday, during lecture timeslot (9:30-11:30)
* First week's test is a "mock test", afterwards they become real
* Midterm happens in Week 6
