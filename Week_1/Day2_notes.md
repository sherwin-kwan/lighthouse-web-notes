## Day 2 - 15 Sep 2020

## Sherwin's Notes from Morning Announcements

### Technical interviews:

* Technical interviews will take place in Weeks 2, 3, 8, and 9 of the bootcamp. 
* These resemble whiteboarding interviews, the goal is to figure out how you think
* Jamboard and Google Hangouts are used for technical interviews
* They usually take around 1 hour (if you're fast you might get it done in 30 minutes). 
* You will be given an appointment in advance, between noon and 8 pm PT.
* Mentors will message you in Slack when they're ready, but please BE EARLY. 

### Extracurriculars

* Students are encouraged to do extracurricular activities together
* Don't be a loner
* Jackbox games, Zoom timeslots, etc. may be requested from Lighthouse Labs

### Fundamental Fridays

* On Fridays we will "take a step back" and focus more on computer science & theory
* Tests take place every Friday, during lecture timeslot (9:30-11:30)
* First week's test is a "mock test", afterwards they become real
* Midterm happens in Week 6

### Programming Mindset

* Computers are "dumb". They do only what you tell them to do, and no more. Imagine you're teaching an alien or a toddler with no "experience" or "context" about how we normally do things, how to make a PB&J sandwich!
* First thing: "What tools do I use? Where do I find them?"

### Why Use Git?

* Can track changes, prevent merge conflicts, and allow you to revert to a previous version of code if needed
* Simple way to share code and collaborate on a project
* Backs up your code to the cloud in case the worst happens

### How does Git work?

* git init: enable Git in a directory (this creates a hidden /.git folder)
* git remote: use for initial setup of your connection with a remote repo like Github
* git add: move from your working directory to staging area
* git commit: move from staging area to local repo
* git push: move from local repo to remote repo
* git pull: move from remote repo to local repo

* You can use SSH instead of HTTPS connection to prevent having to type your password every time
