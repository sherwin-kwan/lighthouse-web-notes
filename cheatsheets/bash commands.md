<!--- Some simple commands to help you with using BASH (Bourne Again Shell), the standard command line interface in most Linux distributions.
You are using Bash whenever you are on your Lighthouse Labs VM connected through Vagrant. If you have a Linux system on your own computer,
you are most likely also using Bash whenever you open a terminal emulator like GNOME Terminal, Konsole, or Xterm. -->

Whenever you use the command line, you are always "in" a particular folder. So first, you need to find your way around:

## Finding Your Way Around

- **pwd**: Outputs the current folder you are in
- **ls**: Tells you what files and folders are in your current folder
  - *ls -a* will show hidden files and folders too
- **cd**: Change directory - change to a different folder
  - *cd
