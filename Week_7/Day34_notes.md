## Day 34 - 29 Oct 2020

## Custom Hooks

* A *custom hook* is a helper function that builds on one of the default React hooks
* This allows us to separate logic from presentation
* A hook must begin with "use"
* Main purpose: to create modules of code you can call for a particular purpose (like "track where your mouse position is", "track what keys
have been pressed")

## Examples

* *useDocumentTitle* - builds on useEffect to change the document title (a side effect)
